A highly optimized, standalone interaction script for FiveM servers, built from scratch. It provides a seamless way to create custom interaction points that are triggered by a key press, operating with peak performance (0.00ms resmon time).

## âœ¨ Features

This script was designed with performance, ease of use, and customization in mind.

* **Standalone Resource:** No dependencies on any specific framework (like ESX or QBCore). Drop it in and it works.
* **High Performance:** Optimized for zero performance impact, consistently running at **0.00ms** on the resource monitor.
* **Easy Configuration:** A detailed and well-commented `config.lua` file allows for easy setup of interaction points.
* **Export Support:** Use the script's exports in your other resources to dynamically create or remove interaction zones.

Feel free to open an issue if you find any bugs or have suggestions for new features!
