## âœ¨ Features

This script was designed with performance, ease of use, and customization in mind.

* **Standalone Resource:** No dependencies on any specific framework (like ESX or QBCore). Drop it in and it works.
* **High Performance:** Optimized for zero performance impact, consistently running at **0.00ms** on the resource monitor.
* **Easy Configuration:** A detailed and well-commented `config.lua` file allows for easy setup of interaction points.
* **Export Support:** Use the script's exports in your other resources to dynamically create or remove interaction zones.
